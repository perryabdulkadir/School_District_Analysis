# School District Analysis
Columbia Data Science Module 4
## Overview of Analysis

The school district has tasked me with analyzing standardized test scores in reading and math for the district's high schools. Previously, I had completed this analysis in preparation for a school board meeting to determine next year's funding. For this initial analysis, I calculated the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both tests broken down by high school and grade. Additionaly, I analyzed standardized testing performance based on school size and funding per pupil. After completing this initial analysis, I was notified that academic dishonesty was suspected for 9th grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School. The Board asked me to replace the the suspected compromised test results with NaNs and redo the analysis.
